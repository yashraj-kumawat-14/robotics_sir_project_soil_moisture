# robotics-project-template

This project was given to me for writing code for nodemcu to check soil moisture and on off water pump accordingly if moisture is below threshold and also send current reading from soil moisture and state of water pump to thinkspeak cloud from which the custom that i build will get these reading per 10 seconds and display them on the app to user.
